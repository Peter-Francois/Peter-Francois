👋 Hi, I’m @Peter-Francois.
👀 I’m interested in working as a web developer.
🌱 I’m currently learning Python through a course on Udemy.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on various projects to learn from senior developers.
😄 Pronouns: I’m new to IT and feel like a baby learning to walk. I’ve worked in many factories as both a collaborator and a team leader, but IT is the most fascinating field I’ve ever explored.

The Four Agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz serve as my life philosophy:
  1/ Be impeccable with your word: Speak with integrity and say only what you mean.
  2/ Don’t take anything personally: What others do or say is not because of you.
  3/ Don’t make assumptions: Seek clarity instead of making assumptions.
  4/ Always do your best: Strive to do your best in every situation.
